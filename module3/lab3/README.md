# Module 3 Assignment Lab: MongoDB Migration Node Script

The assignment lab for this module is to build a migration script to move data from one MongoDB database to another. 
Unlike the tutorial labs, there will be no step by step instructions but all of the information you need to know 
should be in the modules. Please attempt to solve the assignment lab on your own before viewing the solution.

### MongoDB Migration Node Script
You work at a Bitcoin exchange company. For some reason, the customer data is missing its full address. You have 
customer data only with the street address (building number and street name) but no city, state, country. Also, 
phone numbers are missing too. Luckily, your friends were able to restore the address information from a backup 
replica of a MongoDB instance. You need to write a migration/restoration script which will merge the data from 
the two sources.

You have millions of records so you need to create a script which can run queries to the database in parallel. 
You don't know what is the optimal number of customers to insert into a database at a time so you need to write 
the program to allow for a variable number of documents to be able to be updated at once. This will help to 
determine if it's better to update in groups of 10, 50 or maybe 500 at a time.

You are provided with two sample JSON files customer-data.json and customer-address-data.json which contain 1000 
documents/objects (remember, the real data will have 1000000+ objects). Assume that the order of the objects in 
each file correlates to objects in the other file.


### Execute mongod
    
    mongod -f /etc/mongodb.conf 

### Execute mongo
    
    mongo

### testing 

First install local dependencies:

    npm install

To test just the data migration from the json files to db:

    node migration.js

To delete all documents from db:

    node delete.js
    
To run both scripts:

    sh exec.sh 

### MongoDB shell helpful commands

    > show dbs
    > use customerDB
    > db.customers.find()
    > db.customers.count()
    > db.customers.find( { 'id' : '36' } )

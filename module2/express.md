### Express Overview

**Express.js** is a web framework based on the core Node.js http module and Connect components. The components are 
called middleware and they are the cornerstones of the framework philosophy configuration over convention. 
In other words, Express.js systems are highly configurable, which allows developers to freely pick whatever 
libraries they need for a particular project. For these reasons, the Express.js framework leads to flexibility

>> Hello everyone. Welcome to module two.
In this module, we will cover Express Framework.
Express for framework is the
most popular Node.js framework.
If a Node.js developer
considers to build a web application,
most of the times express
is at least one of the options, of course,
there are other frameworks,
but express is definitely one of
those options for new Node.js projects.
And a lot of existing web projects is build on
express because it's been around for a very,
very long time, especially,
in Node.js because Node.js
it's a relatively new technology.
Express has been for a few years.
It's been around and it's been used in
production at many, many large projects.
So, first of all,
we will discuss why express.
I will highlight some of the benefits of
express and why I think it's
a great framework to use or at least to consider using.
After that, we will look at
the typical structure of your express application.
We will go item-by-item,
and we will discuss what are some of
the components that constitute a proper express app.
After that, we will discuss some of
the features that you can use
to render your response or to send your response back,
and also, how you can work with your real parameters,
extract data from a query string,
and also, how you construct your own middleware.
In case you're wondering what is the middleware,
it's a system of plugins for Express framework.
And we conclude our module with
a nicely round-up obligation.
We will build a RESTful API
which will have a few endpoints,
which will constitute a CRUD.
CRUD, it's create, read, update, and delete.
So, with those four operations,
you will learn how to do pretty much everything
you need to do for a certain RESTful API entity.
This module will give you a good overview of Express,
as well as some practical skills.
So, let's jump straight to the lesson, why Express.js.



### Express Overview

**Express.js** is a web framework based on the core Node.js http module and Connect components. The components are 
called middleware and they are the cornerstones of the framework philosophy configuration over convention. 
In other words, Express.js systems are highly configurable, which allows developers to freely pick whatever 
libraries they need for a particular project. For these reasons, the Express.js framework leads to flexibility 
and high customization in the development of web applications.

This module will build a solid foundation of Express development by teaching the following topics:

### Why Express and Express Installations

* Parsing body
* Useful middleware from npm

### Implementing REST API Routing

* Implement REST API routing
* Handling various HTTP requests
